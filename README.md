# Python Implementation Tasks

This repository contains five practical Python implementation tasks that demonstrate foundational programming concepts, file operations, functional constructs, and custom class usage. These examples are suitable for beginners preparing for technical interviews or building confidence with Python scripting and structuring.

## 🔧 Task Overview

### 1. String, List, and Dictionary Manipulations
Demonstrates basic operations such as string formatting, list updates, and dictionary key-value insertions.

**File:** `task_1_string_list_dict.py`

---

### 2. File Read and Write Operations
Implements a simple script that writes to and reads from a text file using Python's built-in file handling.

**File:** `task_2_file_read_write.py`

---

### 3. List Comprehension (Filter & Transform)
Uses list comprehension to filter even numbers from a list and return their squared values.

**File:** `task_3_list_comprehension.py`

---

### 4. Custom Context Manager
Implements a custom class that uses `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to demonstrate context management with the `with` statement.

**File:** `task_4_custom_context_manager.py`

---

### 5. Creating a Python Package
Defines a simple Python package with an `__init__.py` and a utility module that includes a reusable greeting function.

**Package Folder:** `task_5_package/`  
**Runner File:** `main_for_task_5.py`
